You need to have Composer, Node.js, npm and yarn installed to begin.

When you have Composer, Node.js, npm and yarn installed, you simply clone this project by::

    git clone git@gitlab.com:jbernadas/symfony-react-skeleton.git <name-of-project>

After cloning you can now issue the following commands::

    composer install
    yarn install
    yarn encore dev

That's it.
